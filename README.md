# SmartClock
A small "smart" alarm clock for IoT course.

### Idea
A small clock with alarm and basic functions. Integrationg with WiFi via ESP32 for data sharing, maybe smart home automation. Different sensors for tracking enviroment data and sleep patterns.  


### Parts
- Display: probably E-Ink or 7-segment.
- Sensors: Microphone for noise, temperature, humidity, light.
- Actuators control: attach lights and motor to make waking up easier.
- Main controller: ESP32
